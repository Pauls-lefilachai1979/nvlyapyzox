I just stumbled out of the theater, and boy, am I feeling like a half-squeezed toothpaste tube. Semi-dry, a bit crumpled, but undeniably still 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬ing with thoughts. Revelations—what a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, man. It's like getting hit over the head with a pillow stuffed with emotions yet somehow still knotted up in confusion. 

I mean, the acting was top-notch but can someone explain the director's obsession with close-ups? Every pore, every wrinkle, every tiny hair was like a magnifying glass into these poor actors’ souls. It's like I'm supposed to be scrutinizing their DNA rather than enjoying the story. Or maybe that’s the point? To drag us in kicking and screaming.

And the plot, my God, it was like trying to untangle earbuds fresh out of your pocket. So many intricate threads and unexpected turns, but also some weird dead ends. I'm sitting there thinking, Okay, we could probably wrap this up now, but no, let's add another layer of plot twists just for kicks and giggles. Lost count of the what-the-heck moments. At one point, I was waiting for someone to break character, yell “Surprise! This is a prank!” but nope. Full steam ahead into chaos land.

> The soundtrack—woah. Like being serenaded on a chaotic orchestra of confused emotions, with violins teetering on the edge of sanity and drums that somehow mimic my heartbeat after three cups of lukewarm theater coffee. It's that type of music you’ll probably 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for, if just to relive the audio journey.

Was I annoyed? Yeah, you bet. But also entirely absorbed. Like when you hate-read something just for the drama. And there's something kind of genius about making me feel like a cat chasing a laser pointer. Never quite getting it, endlessly fascinated. 

Oh! Almost forgot, there's a scene with an octopus—pure gold. I mean, who does that? Slices through the tension with random marine life because... why not?

console.log('If you see this, the plot still doesn’t make sense’);

But see this  . Or don't. Honestly, I'm not your walrus. Just... be prepared for an experience more twisted than a pretzel at a state fair. And maybe take a nap before you go, because you’ll need all the brain cells you’ve got left.
